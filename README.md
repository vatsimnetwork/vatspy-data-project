# VAT-Spy Client Data Update Project

# How Do I Submit Updates?

We have chosen GitHub to be the core of this project so far, as it allows for collaboration on the project and near real-time updates to VAT-Spy data once a pull request has been pushed to the live data. Updates to data should be made directly by submitting a PR through GitHub. Updates on GitHub that will be pushed will be those that either come from verified GitHub accounts belonging to Regions, Divisions, or FIRs/ARTCCs or that have been explicitly authorized by staff via email.

<br>

# How Do I Verify My Account To Submit Updates?

While we work on a contribution policy, please send an email to, or have your Region, Division, or FIR/ARTCC Leadership send an email from your/their staff Region, Division, or FIR/ARTCC linked e-mail account with your GitHub username to n.perez (at) vatsim.net. Only authorized users from each Region, Division, or FIR/ARTCC will be permitted to submit updates. **PRs from non-verified accounts will NOT be merged.**
